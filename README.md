# Thales Big-Bang
This code is developed in Django web framework. This web application generates an arduino file based on the input of the user (from the web browser). This web app is built for Big Bang Fair in which Thales (the company I am working for) is taking part.

Steps required to run this app:
* Download the latest versoin of Django [djangoproject.com].I used version 1.9.2 when I made this application. My recommendation is to install Django after activating `virtualenv` (This procedure is given in djangoproject.com) 
* Download this code
* In the terminal, go to to the location which contains `manage.py` [i.e., cd bigbang/]
* Run `python manage.py runserver`
* Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web-browser [I tested this code in Google Chrome]
* Bingo! Now you should have this code running in your browser
